Hey there! This is just a short introduction about me on personal & professional front, some bits on the blog too. My journey of life has been centered mostly around startups, tech, product, finance, management & leadership, but sometime back I also got deeply interested in sanskrit & related literature.

## Personal

In the journey of life, I was always inclined towards seeking moksha/nirvana and on some level wanted to pursue as well, probably not ready yet both physically & mentally but I belive things are moving towards that direction, although seems slow, the progress is what matters. 

On personal front, I like to read books (and more than that collect wide variety of books), enjoy lot of deep thinking & discussions around thinking, particularly focused on language. The interest on language pushed me to learn sanskrit and also understand the ecosystem which was built on that. Language can be the underlying basis for a civilisation and while human speech itself is limited by vocal chord, but still the mental models can be built in language which will be very distinct in each language.

Although I am focusing a lot on getting towards bit more organised thinking & deeper world view, I am always looking forward & inspired to learn new ways of thinking which can enable me to break the limitations of mind.

## Blog

The blog is reflections on the personal front only, sharing learnings and thoughts, mostly should not linked with professional work. The topics are also going to be some of the things which I like on personal level only like sanskrit (and language in general), self balanced bikes etc.

Have published bit more detailed intro on the blog here - <https://akhil.blog/2022/01/23/introducing-blog/>. Have questions or suggestions? Plesae feel free to reach to me.
