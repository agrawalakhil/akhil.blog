  This is a post from the past and brought here with minor changes only.

It is always interesting to see the past and learn from that, the impact of technology on various sectors & industries has been tremendous in past 100 years and its only accelearting. 

## Disruption & Tech Disruption
* *Disruption* describes a process whereby a smaller company with fewer resources is able to successfully challenge established incumbent businesses. 
* *Tech Disruption* describes a disruption which happens due to technology - it is the primary enabler, incubator, facilitator or the sole reason.

## When does tech disruption happens ?
* Technology is mature enough
* Sector is ready for change
* Product timing matches the technology maturity & sector readiness

## Disruption - Four Stages
* Disruption (introduce product with new point of view)
* Evolution (innovate rapidly along this new trajectory)
* Convergence (complete value proposition relative to legacy)
* Re-imagination (rethink the entire category)

## Why tech disruption happens ?
Technologies evolving faster than ever changing the way things are done.

## Good examples of tech disruption
* Low end market (niche & less valuable to large players) - Uber, Micromax
* New market (market doesnâ€™t even exist before but need is there) - Square, Tally

## Sector properties to predict readiness
Less regulated, Low CAPEX, no entry barrier, bad shape, urgent need, less disruption, open to technology, conducive policy, tech infrastructure

## Technology properties to predict maturity
Low cost, skilled people, highly scalable, easy adoption, robust & stable, learning ecosystem, fast evolving, secure & wide application, applied to many sectors, no entry barrier, many capabilities

## Kind of tech disruption
* Disrupting Business - businesses are much more open to change
* Disrupting Us - the way we live (work, interact, think)
* Disrupting Institution - change is slow but happening

## Presentation & References
Got an opportunity to do a short presentation on tech disruption for the college students at IFIM during their IT Club inauguration. Here is the snap of the event & presentation.
