This month has been little busy, doing lot of networking with companies at incubation center as well as organizing second Erlang meetup discussing build tools and speaking on AngularJS at a Javascript meetup. Lot of these meetups were good from different perspectives, here are the details of the presentations prepared for these events.

## Erlang Meetups - [Bangalore Erlang-OTP-ians](https://www.meetup.com/Bangalore-Erlang-OTP-ians/events/past/)

Have been working on Erlang building scalable ad server from 2010 onwards and have built some depth on the topic, wanted to meet other people who were working on the erlang based development.

* **Erlang Latest Version** - This was the first erlang meetup I have hosted, more than 20 developers joined and lot of interesting discussion around
  - Extended Time Functionality
  - SSL & SSH Improvements
  - License Change
  - Performance & Scalability
   
  Here is the [Erlang latest version & opensource projects presentation](https://www.slideshare.net/digikrit/erlang-latest-version-opensource-projects) and snap of the event which was hosted at Bizense (my first startup) office on 23rd Apr, 2016.

* **Erlang Build Tools** - This presentation was made for the meetup on Erlang build tools which basically discussed on different build tools available in Erlang and simple examples for each. Here is the summary of build tools discussed
  - *Emakefile* - A make utility for Erlang providing set of functions similar to unix style make functions. This is packaged with Erlang distribution and is the default build tool.
  - *Erlang.mk* - It is an included file for GNU Make, meaning including it in a Makefile allows building project, building/fetching dependencies and more.
  - *rebar & rebar3* - rebar is self contained Erlang script, easy to distribute and embed in the project, provides dependency management, version 3.x has lot of improvements over 2.x
  - *Mix* - Mix is a command line utility that manages elixir projects but can be used for managing Erlang projects as well.

* **Erlang Supervision Trees** - This was the last meetup on erlang I have hosted, here is [blog post for it](https://akhil.blog/2015/08/31/erlang-supervision-trees/). The erlang community in India is very small, met & came to know many of the excellent erlang developers during these meetups.

## Javascript

Have been associated with frontend development from the long time from college days even before jquery became popular, our product was built using angularjs framework and got an opportunity to discuss on how it works with other developers during a meetup event.

* **AngularJS Anatomy & Directives** - at the [JS Meetup Event](https://www.meetup.com/JavaScriptMeetup/events/230710453/)
  
  Present basic and advanced code examples for AngularJS along with an example on directives. The presentation is much more detailed as it was created for training employees on front end development in my previous company covering web development evolution & concepts, angularjs anatomy, demos, directives, testing & debugging. The presentation talked about the following
  - **Evolution** - Let's start with an overview of the evolution of the web application development over time in the last 6 years from 2011 to 2016.
  - **Concepts** - Angular combines lot of good programming concepts together to create an effective & powerful web application development framework.
  - **Anatomy** - Anatomy of an AngularJS application - understanding structure of angular app with basic & advanced examples.
  - **Demos** - Get familar with wide range of demos on different aspects of AngularJS as well as complete apps and opensource projects.
  - **Directives** - Extend HTML with directives for your application specific functionality abstracted into a reusable & clean interface.
  - **Testing & Debugging** - How AngularJS helps in creating testable application and what tools are available for testing & debugging your app.

Lot of interesting technical discussions with different developers of varied background and experience. Our goal in coming months is to increase interest among developers around open source projects we are working on and also to keep the discussion going deeper on Erlang & Javascript. 

Another interesting meetup I attended this month was Open API Meetup from AWS showing how to integrate with APIs from Exotel, Freshdesk & Reverie. Lot of insights around power of API from the three companies who have already solved very different but real world problems.
